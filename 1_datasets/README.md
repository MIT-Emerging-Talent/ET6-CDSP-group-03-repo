# Data Sources

Throughout this milestone, we have explored and analyzed a variety of data sources to support our objectives. These sources provide critical insights into patterns of displacement, conflict dynamics, and humanitarian needs.

## **Data Categories**

We have organized the data sources into two primary categories based on their thematic focus:

1. **War Events Data**
   This category encompasses data related to the ongoing conflict, including detailed records of daily events such as airstrikes, ground invasions, armed clashes, displacement orders, and issues affecting food security. These datasets are essential
   for monitoring and analyzing the humanitarian and security situation on the ground.

2. **Student Attendance and Performance Logs**
   This category includes data capturing the daily educational activities of students, such as session attendance, duration of participation, quiz scores, and other performance indicators. It provides valuable insights into the impact of conflict and
   displacement on students' access to and engagement with online education.
