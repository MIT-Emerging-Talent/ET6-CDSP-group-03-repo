# Constraints

Some boundaries around our project.

## 1. External

Constraints coming from the outside that our team has no control over:

### 1.1. Project deadlines & milestones

> 1. The project must be completed within the assigned timeline.
> 2. The project is divided into milestones, each will have a deadline that we are
> required to meet it.
> 3. TODO: find the deadlines.

### 1.2. Dataset availability

> We are limited to publicly available or client-provided datasets.

### 1.3. Data privacy & compliance

> We must adhere to data privacy laws (e.g., GDPR)
  and avoid using any personally identifiable information (PII) unless **anonymized**.

### 1.4. Hardware limitations

> We are using our personal laptops with limited processing power and memory
  (e.g., no access to GPUs or high-performance computing).

### 1.5. Internet connectivity

> The project may be affected by slow or unstable internet connections when
 downloading data or accessing cloud services.

## Internal: Involuntary

## 2. Internal: Involuntary

<!--
  constraints that come from within your team, and you have no control over:
  - each of your individual skill levels
  - amount of time available to work on the project
-->
### 2.1. Team Skill Set

> The collective expertise and experience of the team members in specific areas (e.g.,\
machine learning algorithms,  data engineering, domain knowledge, specific tools)
> inherently limit the project's scope and complexity.\
> A lack of expertise in a critical area might necessitate simplification
> or external help.

### 2.2. Time Availability

> The total person-hours the team can realistically commit to the project,
> considering other responsibilities,holidays, and potential   unforeseen absences,
> acts as a fundamental constraint on the amount of work that can be accomplished.

### 2.3. Team Size and Structure

> The number of people on the team and how they are organized can impact
> communication overhead, coordination efforts, and the ability to parallelize tasks.

### 2.4. Prior Knowledge and Context

> The team's existing understanding of the problem domain, the data, and relevant
> prior work can influence the project's starting point and pace.\
> Gaps in knowledge may require additional time for research and learning.

## Internal: Voluntary

<!--
  constraints that your team decided on to help scope the project. they may include:
  - coding style & conventions
  - agree on a code review checklist for the project repository
  - the number of hours you want to spend working
  - only using the colors black and white
-->
