# Constraints

Some boundaries around our project.

## 1. External

Constraints coming from the outside that our team has no control over:

### 1.1. Project deadlines & milestones

> 1. The project must be completed within the assigned timeline.
> 2. The project is divided into milestones, each will have a deadline that we are
> required to meet it.
> 3. TODO: find the deadlines.

### 1.2. Dataset availability

> We are limited to publicly available or client-provided datasets.

### 1.3. Data privacy & compliance

> We must adhere to data privacy laws (e.g., GDPR)
  and avoid using any personally identifiable information (PII) unless **anonymized**.

### 1.4. Hardware limitations

> We are using our personal laptops with limited processing power and memory
  (e.g., no access to GPUs or high-performance computing).

### 1.5. Internet connectivity

> The project may be affected by slow or unstable internet connections when
 downloading data or accessing cloud services.
