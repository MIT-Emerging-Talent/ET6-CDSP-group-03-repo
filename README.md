 while promoting open communication and efficient collaboration. Our goal is to
  create an environment that values diverse perspectives, encourages teamwork,
   and drives success. We support continuous learning and innovative thinking.
    Our shared commitment to growth and development empowers each member to
     contribute and learn from collective experiences, ensuring we work
      together effectively to achieve success.

## Problem statement

In regions affected by war, the education system is one of the first societal structures to collapse.
 Students who once demonstrated high academic performance and consistent attendance often experience
  a significant decline in both after conflict begins. Violence, displacement, psychological trauma,
   and the breakdown of infrastructure such as internet access or school availability contribute
    to reduced academic outcomes and disrupted attendance.

This project investigates how armed conflict affects students' performance and attendance over time.
 By comparing pre-conflict and during-conflict academic records, we aim to understand the depth
  of disruption and identify patterns that can inform targeted interventions.

## research question

How does war disruption such as violence, displacement, and infrastructure breakdown impact students' academic performance and attendance on online learning for students in colleges in war affected zones?

## Group Summary of the Problem Domain (with Systems Thinking)

Our group is focused on understanding the effects of the challenges faced by students in war-affected zones on their educational performance. These students are forced to rely on online education under extreme hardships-from exposure to violence,
displacement, and constant unreliable internet.

Using a systems thinking approach, we analyze the student's environment as a complex system, where various elements—physical safety, mental health, access to education, family displacement, and technology
 infrastructure—interact and reinforce one another. For instance:

      Displacement leads to unstable living conditions → Limited or no access to schools.

      Violence and trauma increase stress → Reduced concentration and motivation.

      Interrupted school services → Lower attendance and academic decline.

These effects often create a negative feedback loop, where low performance leads to disengagement, further worsening outcomes. By understanding these relationships, we aim to propose data-driven strategies to identify at-risk students against these effects.

## 5 Ws and 1 H for our problem statement

| **Question** | **Answer** |
| ------------ | ---------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Who**      | Students in war-affected regions who rely on online platforms for education.|
| **What**     | Their academic engagement and performance are being negatively impacted by conflict-related challenges such as violence, displacement, and unreliable internet access. |
| **Where**    | Conflict zones and war-affected areas where traditional education systems are disrupted.    |
| **When**     | During and after the onset of armed conflicts, particularly when students are displaced or formal schools are shut down.|
| **Why**      | War introduces instability and trauma, while displacement disrupts routine and internet access; these factors collectively harm students’ ability to learn and perform academically.|
| **How**      | By analyzing student interaction and performance data on online platforms,and assessing whether AI tools (e.g., adaptive learning, offline content, emotional support bots) can help mitigate the negative impacts and support effective learning.|
