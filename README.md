## Problem statement

In war-affected regions, students are often forced to pursue their education through online platforms under extremely challenging conditions. These students face constant exposure to violence, displacement, and unreliable internet access.
These factors significantly impact their academic performance.
This study aims to investigate the effect of these hardships
caused by war on their learning performance on online platforms and measure how AI can help in their learning process.

## research question

How do factors such as violence, displacement, and internet instability specifically affect students' engagement and performance on online learning platforms?

## Group Summary of the Problem Domain (with Systems Thinking)

Our group is focused on understanding the effects of the challenges faced by students in war-affected zones on their educational performance. These students are forced to rely on online education under extreme hardships-from exposure to violence,
displacement, and constant unreliable internet.

By using a systems thinking approach, we view the student's learning environment, including physical safety (violence from war and displacement), technological infrastructure (internet access and device availability), educational content delivery
(online platforms),
and support systems, including potential AI-driven tools.

For example, displacement leads to unstable living conditions, which worsen internet access and increase stress. This stress, in turn, lowers motivation and focus, which directly affects learning. Poor performance may lead to low engagement, creating
a negative feedback loop. We aim to explore this system and investigate how AI can support these students to learn more effectively.

Here is the **5Ws and 1H** table for your problem statement, tailored to highlight key aspects of the issue:

| **Question** | **Answer** |
| ------------ | ---------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Who**      | Students in war-affected regions who rely on online platforms for education.|
| **What**     | Their academic engagement and performance are being negatively impacted by conflict-related challenges such as violence, displacement, and unreliable internet access. |
| **Where**    | Conflict zones and war-affected areas where traditional education systems are disrupted.    |
| **When**     | During and after the onset of armed conflicts, particularly when students are displaced or formal schools are shut down.                                                                                                                            |
| **Why**      | War introduces instability and trauma, while displacement disrupts routine and internet access; these factors collectively harm studentsâ€™ ability to learn and perform academically.                                                                |
| **How**      | By analyzing student interaction and performance data on online platforms, and assessing whether AI tools (e.g., adaptive learning, offline content, emotional support bots) can help mitigate the negative impacts and support effective learning. |
