# 5Ws + 1H Framework for Research Problems in War-Affected Education and AI Context

This document outlines the 5Ws and 1H (Who, What, When, Where, Why, How) for each
research problem related to online learning, AI usage,
and performance in war-affected zones.

## Problem 1

* Author: [Salem Amassi](https://github.com/salemAmassi)
* Problem Statement: [Refere to problems_pool](/0_domain_study/problems_pool.md#problem-1)
* 5 Ws and 1 H Framework:

## 1.1. Summary Table

| **Aspect** | **Summary** |
|------------|-------------|
| **Who** | - College students in online learning (e.g., Gaza) - Instructors, admins, counselors, data scientists |
| **What** | - Predict academic risk: dropout, score drops, stress levels - Data: grades, behavior, conflict timelines |
| **When** | - During semester, especially post-attacks or around deadlines - Predictions updated weekly or in real-time |
| **Where** | - Conflict zones (e.g., Gaza)- Data from LMS, messaging apps, humanitarian sources |
| **Why** | - Conflict harms student performance - Need to detect stress early to support learning and well-being |
| **How** | - Analyze LMS interactions and timelines - Correlate with conflict events - Build predictive models for risk |

## 1.2. Details

### 1. **Who**

**Affected People:**

* College students in online learning environments,
primarily in conflict zones (e.g., Gaza)

**Stakeholders:**

* Instructors: who need early alerts to intervene
* School administrators: to design support systems
* Mental health counselors: for timely outreach
* Data scientists: building predictive models

---

### 2. **What**

**Problem:**

* Early signs of stress and disengagement often go unnoticed until
performance drops significantly.

**What do we want to predict?**

* Academic risk, such as:
  * Dropout or course failure
  * Sudden drops in quiz/assignment scores
  * Stress risk level (low/medium/high)

**What data is needed?**

* Academic performance (grades, submissions)
* Behavioral signals (logins, inactivity)
* Displacement orders and military activity logs

---

### 3. **When**

**When does the issue occur?**

* Throughout the course, but especially:
  * After major conflict events (e.g., bombings, displacements)
  * Near deadlines or exams
  * After long inactivity periods

**When should predictions be made?**

* Continuously (weekly or real-time updates)
* Ideally early in the semester for proactive intervention

---

### 4. **Where**

**Where are the students located?**

* In conflict-affected areas (e.g., Gaza)
* Often displaced and facing infrastructure disruption

**Where will the data be collected?**

* Within Learning Management Systems (e.g., Moodle, Google Classroom, Canvas)
* Messaging platforms (e.g., WhatsApp, Telegram) in low-connectivity settings (in production version)
* Learning analytics tools or app logs
* International humanitarian institutions tracking war-related events

---

### 5. **Why**

**Why is this important?**

* Students in high-stress environments are at risk of academic failure or dropout
* Early detection can:
  * Save academic careers
  * Improve mental health outcomes
  * Enable personalized, compassionate support

**Why now?**

* The ongoing war in Gaza has deeply disrupted education
* Traditional support systems are broken
* Online learning is the primary method for displaced students — and it's rich in
behavioral signals

## Problem 2

* Author: [Salem Amassi](https://github.com/salemAmassi)
* Problem Statement: [Refere to problems_pool](/0_domain_study/problems_pool.md#problem-2)
* 5 Ws and 1 H Framework:

## 2.1 Summary Table

| **Aspect** | **Summary** |
|------------|-------------|
| **Who** | University students in war zones (e.g., Gaza, Ukraine, Syria), enrolled in online higher ed programs (e.g., IT), often under stress, using AI tools |
| **What** | Studying the effect of conflict-induced stress on learning and how AI tools (e.g., ChatGPT, Grammarly) are used — ethically or unethically |
| **When** | During armed conflicts: bombings, displacement, internet/power outages, emotional crises |
| **Where** | Conflict regions or refugee camps; Data from LMS platforms, surveys, and AI tool usage logs |
| **Why** | To understand AI’s role in learning during crises and design ethical, supportive AI-integrated education systems |

## 2.2 Details

### **Who**

**University students in war-affected zones**, such as:

* Gaza
* Ukraine
* Syria

**Especially those:**

* Enrolled in online higher education (e.g., IT programs)
* Experiencing conflict-induced stress
* Using online platforms to learn
* Potentially relying on AI tools for support — or academic dishonesty

---

### **What**

**Investigating:**

* How conflict-related stress affects learning performance
* How AI tools (e.g., ChatGPT, Grammarly, Copilot) are being used

**Key questions:**

* What patterns of AI usage exist under stress?
* Are students using AI to cheat, cope, or enhance learning?
* How does this correlate with:
  * Academic performance (grades)
  * Engagement
  * Emotional resilience

### **When**

**During periods of ongoing armed conflict**, including:

* Bombings or military activity
* Internet/power outages
* Emotional distress and displacement

---

### **Where**

**In war-affected regions**, such as:

* Universities in Gaza, Ukraine, etc.
* Displaced students studying from refugee camps

**Data sources:**

* LMS data from local universities
* Surveys from displaced students
* AI usage logs from digital platforms
* War events to link activites with them.

### **Why**

**To understand:**

* The impact of war-related stress on learning outcomes
* Whether AI tools help or harm students under pressure
* How to design ethical, AI-integrated education systems for crisis contexts
