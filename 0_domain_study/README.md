# AI in Conflict Education - Research Overview

## 1. Problem Statement Refinement

**Core Issue**: War-induced challenges (violence exposure, displacement, unreliable internet) degrade online learning performance for conflict-affected students.  
**AI Opportunity**: Can AI tools mitigate these barriers?

### Key Challenges to Investigate

- Psychological trauma → Reduced concentration/motivation
- Internet instability → Disrupted learning continuity
- Frequent displacement → Lack of consistent study environments
- Resource scarcity → Limited device/power access

## 2. Domain Research Summary

| Sub-Folders Domain | Research Focus | Sources |
|--------|----------------|---------|
| **Education in Conflict** | - Existing studies on war's impact on learning outcomes\n- Case studies (Ukraine, Gaza, Syria) | UNESCO reports, Journal of Education in Emergencies, ReliefWeb |
| **Online Learning Barriers** | - Metrics for "learning performance" in unstable contexts\n- Technical requirements for low-bandwidth platforms | World Bank EdTech papers, IEEE Learning Technology publications |
| **AI in Education** | - Proven AI solutions for similar challenges (e.g., offline tutors, adaptive content)\n- Ethical risks (data privacy, bias) | Google AI Education, arXiv papers on "AI for low-resource learning" |
| **Stakeholders** | - NGOs delivering remote education (e.g., UNICEF)\n- EdTech platforms (e.g., Kolibri, Learning Equality) | Annual reports of humanitarian organizations, EdTech startup case studies |

## 3. Actionable Research Question

**Proposed Question**:  
"To what extent can lightweight AI interventions (e.g., offline-adaptive content, trauma-aware chatbots) improve knowledge retention and course completion rates for online learners in conflict zones, given constraints of intermittent connectivity
 and psychological stress?"

**Why This Works**:

- **Measurable**: Focuses on quantifiable metrics (retention rates, completion %).
- **Feasible**: Targets "lightweight" AI solutions (no heavy compute/bandwidth needed).
- **Context-Aware**: Explicitly addresses war-specific constraints.
- **Actionable**: Guides data collection on specific AI tools vs. traditional methods.

## 4. Constraints & Feasibility

| Constraint | Mitigation Strategy |
|-----------|----------------------|
| No primary data from war zones | Use proxy datasets (e.g., refugee learning platforms, low-income connectivity studies) |
| Time/Limited tech access | Test AI prototypes via simulations (e.g., artificial network throttling, stress surveys) |
| Ethical sensitivities | Partner with NGOs for anonymized data; avoid traumatizing questions |

## 5. Stakeholder Analysis

**Actors Who Can Implement Findings**:

- NGOs (e.g., Save the Children)
- EdTech Developers: Optimize apps for conflict zones (e.g., offline-first AI).
- Governments: Inform policy for digital education in emergencies.

## 6. Recommended Approach for Your Group

- **Literature Review (4 hrs)**: Divide research topics (education, tech, conflict studies).
- **Stakeholder Mapping (2 hrs)**: Identify NGOs/developers for interview requests.
- **Refine Research Question (1 hr)**: Use the "PICO framework":
  - **Population**: War-affected online learners
  - **Intervention**: Lightweight AI tools
  - **Comparison**: Traditional online learning
  - **Outcomes**: Completion rates, knowledge retention
- **Simulation Design (1 hr)**: Plan low-bandwidth/stress simulations (e.g., using existing LMS data).
