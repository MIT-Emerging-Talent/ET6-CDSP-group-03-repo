# Domain Study

## Brainstorming Workflow

We thoroughly documented our thought process throughout the project, capturing how we continuously shifted between **divergent thinking** and **onvergent thinking**.\
In **divergent thinking** where we explored multiple possibilities, generated ideas, and considered various perspectives.\
In **convergent thinking** where we narrowed down options, synthesized insights, and made decisions. This iterative approach was applied at each step of the process, enabling us to balance creativity with focus
and ensure our solutions were both innovative and grounded in clear reasoning.
