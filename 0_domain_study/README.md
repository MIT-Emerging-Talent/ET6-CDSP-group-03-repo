# Domain Study

## Brainstorming Workflow

> We thoroughly documented our thought process throughout the project, capturing how we continuously shifted between **divergent thinking** and **onvergent thinking**.\
In **divergent thinking** where we explored multiple possibilities, generated ideas, and considered various perspectives.\
In **convergent thinking** where we narrowed down options, synthesized insights, and made decisions. This iterative approach was applied at each step of the process, enabling us to balance creativity with focus
and ensure our solutions were both innovative and grounded in clear reasoning.\

## Problems Pool

>This document compiles a range of problem statements and research questions generated through brainstorming sessions, focusing on education in challenging contextsâ€”particularly war-affected\
The focus is on how **armed conflict affects education**, with particular attention to **student performance and attendance**, and how education systems can adapt under extreme circumstances.

The problems are grouped into several thematic areas:

1. **Impact of War on Student Performance and Attendance**  
   * Understanding how violence, displacement, and infrastructure breakdown lead to lower academic achievement and reduced school participation.

2. **Education Infrastructure Breakdown**  
   * Evaluating how school closures, internet instability, and forced migration disrupt students' ability to maintain consistent learning.

3. **Learning Continuity in Conflict Zones**  
   * Investigating how students manage to continue learning despite the absence of formal schooling and stable environments.

4. **Data Use in Conflict Zones**  
   * Exploring how educational data (e.g., attendance records, exam scores) can be used to assess and respond to the impact of conflict on learners.
  
## Systems Thinking

* We applied a **systems thinking** approach to examine the broader environment affecting students in conflict areas. By using the **Iceberg Model**, we visualized how surface-level issuesâ€”such as declining attendance or performanceâ€”are
 driven by deeper systemic forces like trauma, displacement, loss of routine, and lack of infrastructure.

## Five Ws and One H Framework

*To better understand the scope of our problem, we used the "Five Ws and One H" framework to define the **Who**, **What**, **Where**, **When**, **Why**, and **How** of our research focus.

### ðŸ“‚ 2. Attendance and Dropout Trends

**Focus**:  
Tracks how conflict impacts student attendance, school dropout rates, and school closuresâ€”especially in relation to displacement or infrastructure destruction.

**Resources Include**:

* Attendance datasets and longitudinal reports  
* UNHCR and UNICEF data on refugee education access  
* Articles on school retention strategies in conflict areas

### ðŸ“‚ 3. Learning Continuity and Educational Access

**Focus**:  
Explores strategies that have been implemented to ensure learning continues during conflict, especially when students lose access to formal schooling or teaching staff.

**Resources Include**:

* Reports on low-tech and offline learning methods  
* PDFs on blended learning and alternative delivery models  
* Articles on education through radio, print packets, or mobile learning initiatives

### ðŸ“‚ 4. Stakeholders / Private or Non Profit Organizations

**Focus**:  
Identifies humanitarian organizations, NGOs, educational ministries, and community-based programs that support conflict-zone education and help maintain educational continuity.

**Resources Include**:

* Strategy reports from UNICEF, UNHCR, and Save the Children  
* Case studies of NGO-school partnerships in emergencies  
* Databases of global education projects in crisis zones
